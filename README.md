# Digits
A simple neural net creator for recognizing digits from the mnist dataset
A VS project written in C++ for creating and training neural networks on the MNIST database.
Once training is complete, you can save your net to a specified filename, and load it again later.
There is also a simple drawing application using SDL that allows you to draw your own digits and have your net evaluate them.
The training/net loading portion is command line operated.
The database is included in the repo, along with the necessary SDL files.
